# Flutter PhotoFilters
A flutter application that mimics Snapchat's lenses/filters using Firebase ML for face detection.

It is very basic, and is only able to place images on top of [face landmarks](https://pub.dev/documentation/firebase_ml_vision/latest/firebase_ml_vision/FaceLandmarkType-class.html) defined by Firebase.

I wanted to add more advanced placement options using contours, but as it was my final project for a class I did not have enough time to implement it.

Think of this as a more advanced Firebase ML face detection demo.

## Detailed Report
There is a [detailed report](/report.docx) talking about this project that I wrote for my class talking about extra details involved in making this app that were required by the professor.
It also contains more screenshots and more detailed explanations about them.
